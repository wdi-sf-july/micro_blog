# Blog Part 3 - Password Reset

For tonight's lab we'd like you to finish up the authentication and authorization components discussed and make sure that users can reset their password. At the same time, continue to refactor your code and spend some time thinking about the styling. You will be presenting as a group __again__ 

**Thursday** morning where we will expect you to have a working and styled blog.

## Requirements

1. Complete the rest of the reset password flow. Now that you have mailers and a new password controller setup, create the rest of the controller actions. Pick up where you left up, with a link to a controller containing the passed in random value

2. Ensure that you are caught up on authentication, polymorphic associations and any other topics that are tripping your group up. You are going to be working with all of these concepts next week for project II, so make sure you are feeling comfortable with the concepts and syntax.
3. Begin/continue to style your blog using your own styling or a css framework.

## Topics to review with your group

1. MVC
2. Model Associations (including polymorphic associations)
3. Nested resources
4. Flash messages 
4. Authentication + Authorization
5. Password reset + Mailers


## Bonus

1. Try to get your app running on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4)
